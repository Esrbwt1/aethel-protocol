# Aethel Protocol - Off-Chain Contribution Ledger

This ledger meticulously tracks all non-code and code contributions to the Aethel Protocol prior to the mainnet launch. Each entry represents a "proof-of-value" claim that will be ratified by the Genesis Guild and converted into a corresponding distribution of SRT and VAL at the Genesis Event.
